PA3: TCP File Distribution System
CSCI 4273

The parts that my program can implement:
-clients are able to connect to the server via TCP and execute the commands above
-clients are able to send and receive TCP messages and send files to each other
-server correctly routes all file requests  to the correct clients

The parts that still have bugs:
After the client enter the command "Get <file>", the program cannot automatically 
finish the downloading work in the back scene. That means, the client that is responsible for
sending files needs to enter the return key to start the sending process. All the rest
works will be finished automatically. I don't know how to solve this small problem.

Compile
make
make clean

Run
./server <port #>
./client <client name> <server ip> <server port #> <file1>,<file2>,<file3>,

Client Actions
>List
>SendMyFilesList
>Get <file>
>Exit
